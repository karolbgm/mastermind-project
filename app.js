//Design
//Create my board/design my wireframe

//Logic
//Create an array with 4 colors as elements
//Create an empty array to store computer's selection
//Make computer choose 4 colors from my colors array randomly and append to my empty array
//User will select colors from a dropdown color menu for each of the 4 holes
//Once user completes all holes, they will be able to submit guess 
//Guess will be saved to an user array
//Computer will compare user array with its own array
//Computer will check if:
//1 - color is contained inside computer array
//2 - color is in the same index position of computer array

//Conditionals:
//if color is contained but not on the same position: white peg
////if color is contained and on the same position: black peg
//After that, Computer will select a position from feedback array and change color to black or white in the same comparison order

//Checking wins 
// If feedback grid is all black - user wins, else user guesses again
//Computer selection is displayed on board
//Restart option

//Check current guess number
//do not go over 11
//If user does not guess correctly within the 11 tries, game is over and computer wins
//Restar option


//Feedback Grid
//Each circle is going to correspond to a specific index position of a feedback array
// const guess1 = [position1, position2, positon3, position4]
